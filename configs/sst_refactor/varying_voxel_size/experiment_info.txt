We do trials with constant window shape of (16,16,1), and varies voxel sizes. Thus, the effective window size will also vary.
We perform the initial trials with 2 merged sweeps, and remove the close points up to 2 meters from the car.
Using 2 merged sweeps to stay constant with Johans resent trials, though we could also investigate other merge sizes whenever we have merged all our branches to main.
